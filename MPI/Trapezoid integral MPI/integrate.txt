in assignment1-part1 //hello
i use the
MPI_Init // to tell MPI system to do all of the  necessary  setup
 MPI_Comm_rank //the calling process in the communicator
and MPI_Comm_size //number of process in communicator
and give each process message to print it out

in assignment1-part2 //target.cpp  << section 1>>
	
	computing trapezoid integral in serial version , normal calling of function 
	and include header file of function that we compute tapezoid on it

in assignment1-part2 //mpi_integrate_v1.cpp  << section 2>>

	
	include header file of function that we compute tapezoid on it
	, check if parameter in comand line > 2 to  print out the result of 
	trapezoid on screen, 
	using MPI_Send to send local_integral that each process compute it to 
	the root process(0) , and the root process apply  summation on local integral
	to produce the total integral after recive them  
	
in assignment1-part2 //mpi_integrate_v2.cpp  << section 3>>

		i do all the steps in the previous section but using MPI_ANY_SOURCE



in assignment1-part2 //mpi_integrate_v3.cpp << section 4>> 

	
	i used MPI_Resduce alternatively of MPI_Send & MPI_Recv to compute trapezoid 
	using MPI_SUM operator , that do the job of All MPI in section 2 and 3 in 
	shortly way
